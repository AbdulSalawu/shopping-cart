# Shopping Cart

A Shopping Cart app to help me practice using react-redux store and slices. The application allows me to search an API for items for a shop, then I use react-redux to add items to cart all in one 'store' state with a 'cart' reducer. 

This Project used JS and CSS with Tailwind CSS, and React-Redux.
